[h1]Provides a per-player configurable keybind to force the necessary analog inputs to fast roll![/h1]

[b]Normally, this is only feasible on controller with precise analog inputs;
now, you can perform it on keyboard too, with the press of a button![/b]

To perform a fast roll, hold the fast roll button [u]instead[/u] of down when beginning a roll!

When chaining fast rolls, will require you to hold down briefly to begin the roll - any Y input during the roll will override the fast roll input!
